## Upwork Terms of Service - Key Points

❌ **Automated job applications** - Submitting proposals without human review  
❌ **Bot behavior** - Automated actions that mimic human activity

## Detailed Compliance Analysis

### 1. Job Highlighting Feature

**What it does:**
- Reads job posting timestamps (publicly visible)
- Adds visual border to jobs posted within 1 hour
- Similar to using browser's built-in "Find" feature

**Why it's compliant:**
- Only reads data already displayed on screen
- Does NOT send automated requests to Upwork servers
- Does NOT access private/restricted information
- Purely cosmetic enhancement on client side
- Equivalent to manually scanning timestamps

**Analogy:** Like highlighting text with a marker while reading

---

### 2. Cover Letter Generation Feature

**What it does:**
- Extracts job details from the page you're viewing
- Sends data to OpenAI (NOT to Upwork)
- Generates a draft cover letter
- Places text in textarea for USER to review

**Why it's compliant:**
- Acts as a **writing assistant** (like Grammarly, ChatGPT, or spell-check)
- Requires **explicit user review** before submission
- User maintains **full control** over what gets submitted
- Does NOT click "Submit" button automatically
- Does NOT send proposals on your behalf

**Critical distinction:**
```
❌ VIOLATION: Auto-submits proposals without user seeing them
✅ COMPLIANT: Drafts text, user reviews/edits/submits manually
```

**Analogy:** Like having a writing assistant draft an email for you to review and send

---

### 3. Data Access & Privacy

**What data the extension accesses:**
- ✅ Job titles, descriptions, budgets (public)
- ✅ Client names, locations, ratings (public)
- ✅ Required skills, experience levels (public)

- ❌ Other freelancers' proposals (private)
- ❌ Client contact information (restricted)

**Data flow:**
1. Extension reads DOM (same as browser displays)
2. Sends to OpenAI API (your personal API key)
3. Returns generated text
4. YOU review and submit (or don't)

**No data is sent to Upwork servers by this extension.**
